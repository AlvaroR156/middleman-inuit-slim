Picturefill has three versions:

* Version 3 is currently a beta release. It boasts a deadly accurate set of parsers, and matches a number of native behaviors that Picturefill 2.x didn’t—but also meant a near-complete rewrite. **That means we need testers.** Please give the 3.0.0 beta a try, and [let us know](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill/issues) if you run into any issues.

* Version 2.3.1 is the current stable. Due to a [serious bug](https://css-tricks.com/please-update-picturefill/), please immediately update to 2.3.1 if you are currently using a earlier version.

* Version 1 mimics the Picture element pattern with `span` elements. It is no longer maintained.
